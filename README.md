Redis Event Viewer - iOS App
Overview
The Redis Event Viewer is a simple iOS application that allows users to visualize data stored in Redis through a backend API. The app interacts with a Python Flask backend that fetches data from Redis and displays real-time events in a user-friendly interface. This app can be used to track keystrokes, mouse movements, or active window changes stored in Redis, and displays them in a structured format on your iOS device.

Features
Backend Integration: The app fetches data from Redis using a Python Flask backend that serves the data through a REST API.

Real-time Data: The app uses URLSession to periodically fetch data from the backend or can be enhanced with WebSocket support for real-time updates.

Simple and Interactive UI: Displays events in a list format with event type, timestamp, and data using SwiftUI.

Customizable Data: Easily extend the app to work with different types of Redis data like user inputs, system events, or other data streams.

Tech Stack
iOS Frontend: Swift, SwiftUI

Backend: Python, Flask, Redis

Data Fetching: URLSession for RESTful API calls

Data Format: JSON for easy parsing between iOS app and backend

Installation & Setup
Backend Setup (Python Flask):

Clone the backend repository.

Install the necessary dependencies by running:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask server with:

bash
Copy
python app.py
Make sure Redis is running locally and that the appropriate data is being pushed into Redis.

iOS Frontend Setup:

Clone the iOS frontend repository.

Open the RedisEventViewer.xcodeproj in Xcode.

Ensure that the backend URL is correctly set to your local server (or deploy the backend to a remote server if needed).

Build and run the app on a simulator or physical device.

How It Works
The iOS app fetches data from the Flask backend using URLSession.

The Flask backend fetches data from Redis and returns it as JSON.

The iOS app displays the events in a List using SwiftUI.

Event details, such as the type, timestamp, and data, are displayed for each event.

Optionally, you can implement WebSocket support for real-time event updates.

Future Enhancements
Real-time Updates: Implement WebSocket support for real-time data fetching from Redis.

Error Handling: Add more robust error handling for network and data issues.

User Interface Improvements: Enhance the UI with animations, filtering, and more interactive features.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or create pull requests to improve the app. Please follow the coding style used in the project and make sure to write tests for new features.
